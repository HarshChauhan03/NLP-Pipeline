Welcome to the **NLP Pipeline Project** 🚀  
This repository demonstrates a **complete Natural Language Processing (NLP) workflow**, starting from raw text and ending with a real-world NLP task.

This project is built as a **step-by-step pipeline** to understand how machines process and analyze human language.

## 📌 What is NLP?

**Natural Language Processing (NLP)** is a field of Artificial Intelligence that enables computers to understand, interpret, and work with human language such as:

- Reviews  
- Tweets  
- Emails  
- Chat messages  
- Articles  
- Social media text

## 🔥 Project Objective

The goal of this project is to practically implement the **complete NLP pipeline** from scratch.

By the end of this project, we can:

✅ Clean noisy text  
✅ Convert text into tokens  
✅ Remove unimportant words  
✅ Reduce words to root form  
✅ Convert text into numerical features  
✅ Perform Sentiment Analysis
