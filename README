# 🧠 NLP Pipeline Project – From Text to Intelligence

Welcome to the **NLP Pipeline Project** 🚀  
This repository demonstrates a **complete Natural Language Processing (NLP) workflow**, starting from raw text and ending with a real-world NLP task.

This project is designed as a **step-by-step pipeline** to understand how machines process human language.
